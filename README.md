# PandaJS Demos

All these demos are viewable on the [PandaJS Site](http://www.pandajs.net/showcase/).  But the demos are runnable locally by cloning the repo and installing the nodejs dependancies via npm.

## Installing for local development

You will need [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) which comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).  For installation please google there are plenty of resources on how to install for your platform.

Once installed just run the npm dependacies

    npm install .

Then run the local [express server](http://expressjs.com/)

    node server.js

Inside your browser point the url to `http://localhost:5975/`
